This repository will be used to share all documents related to CS282 RL in Healthcare Final Project.

## random ideas on the plate
- keeping learned policy close to the clinician's policy
- estimate the reward function of clinicians to supervise the policy search (i.e. use the estimated reward to decide whether to give permission for taking rare actions)
- generative model of trajectories (aritificial trajectories)
